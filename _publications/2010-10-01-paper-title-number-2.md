In 2024, I participated in the FLTRP & Guocai Cup "Understanding Contemporary China" English Comprehensive Ability Open Contest, where I was awarded the second prize at the national level. This competition is designed to assess and promote the comprehensive English language skills of college students, focusing on their ability to understand and articulate contemporary issues in China. It provides a platform for students to showcase their proficiency in English and their insights into China's development and global engagement.
