In the 2024 China Robot Competition, I led a project on non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging technology. This project focused on deploying an NLOS imaging system on unmanned platforms to enhance public safety. The system leverages advanced imaging techniques to capture and process images from non-direct line-of-sight angles, enabling more effective surveillance and threat detection in complex environments. Our team's innovative approach and technical implementation earned us the first prize in the competition, demonstrating the potential of NLOS imaging in practical applications.
