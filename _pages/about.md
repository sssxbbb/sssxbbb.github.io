🔆I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of CSAI](https://www7.zzu.edu.cn/csai/), [Zhengzhou University](https://www.zzu.edu.cn/). My research interests include NLOS(Non-Line-of-Sight), NSFOL, machine learning, and Operating System. I've led projects like the Non-Line-of-Sight Intelligent Imaging System and participated in competitions, winning awards such as the first prize in [the 2024 China Robot Competition](../images/robocup.jpg).

❤️Beyond academics, I am actively involved in student affairs, serving as the Vice President of the School’s Youth League Committee. I have also been deeply engaged in volunteer work, earning recognitions like the “Outstanding Youth Volunteer” award from Zhengzhou University. Additionally, I am the campus ambassador for [Huawei Student Developers (HSD) at Zhengzhou University](../assets/HSD_Certification.pdf), promoting innovation and technology among students.
